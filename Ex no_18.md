## AIM:
To write a C program to find frequency of a character in the given input.

## Algorithm
1.Start.

2.Define the required variable.

3.Write program to find frequency of a character.

4.Read the value using scanf.

5.Ask the user to make an input.

6.Print out the answer.

7.End.

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
#include<string.h> 
int main()
{
int i,count=0,len;
char str[100],val[100]; 
scanf("%s %s",str,val); 
len=strlen(str); 
for(i=0;i<len;i++){
if(str[i]==val[0]) 
count++;
}printf("%d",count);
}
```

## Output:
<img width="278" height="296" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/544d6475-11d6-449c-9122-4a524d286b5f" />




## Result:
